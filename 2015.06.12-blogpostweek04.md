This is my week 04 its been kind of very hectic and very confusing 
working on Chapter02. The many times in this chapter I felt lost 
and not knowing what I was doing nor why, but I have gotten help
from a couple of my classmates that can explain to me stuff much 
more simple so I could understand this. I loved the activity you
assigned each one of us to work on that was pretty cool and 
creative working with the Scrum Board.
